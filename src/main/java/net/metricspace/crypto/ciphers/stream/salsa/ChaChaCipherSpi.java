/**
 * A {@link javax.crypto.CipherSpi} base class for ChaCha{@code N}
 * variants.  ChaCha is a sub-family of the Salsa family, introduced
 * by Daniel J. Bernstein in 2008.  ChaCha shares the basic structure
 * of Salsa, but aims to improve on both diffusion and performance.
 * The ChaCha20 variant is used frequently in the modern open-source
 * community.
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * This class should not be used directly.  It provides the underlying
 * implementation for the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA).  See
 * the {@link javax.crypto.Cipher} class documentation for information
 * on how to use this cipher.
 * <h2>Misuses</h2>
 *
 * The following are possible misuses of the ChaCha family ciphers.
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Encrypting multiple plaintexts with the same cipher
 * stream</b>: As with other stream ciphers, the ChaCha family's cipher
 * stream is generated solely from the key, IV, and starting position,
 * and is XORed with the plaintext to produce the cipher stream.
 * Thus, if multiple plaintexts are encrypted with the same cipher
 * stream, attackers can recover information about the plaintexts as
 * well as the cipher stream.
 * <li> <b>Re-using initialization vecctors</b>: Reuse of
 * initialization vectors leads to encryption of multiple plaintexts
 * with the same IV.
 * <li> <b>Ciphertext Manipulation</b>: Since encryption/decryption
 * consists of XORing the plaintext/ciphertext by the cipher stream,
 * an attacker can flip bits in the plaintext by flipping them in the
 * ciphertext, unless the message is also protected by a message
 * authentication code (MAC).
 * </ul>
